                  AJ Auto Rentals is special, because it is not a real company
                  or website. This is a portfolio project for myself. You can
                  visit my website at www.abhijoshi.com to view other projects.

                  The best car in the fleet has to be the Lambirghini Urus. It
                  is a dream car for myself and I would love the opportunity to
                  drive it someday.

                  The prices at AJ Auto Rentals are low compared to any other
                  luxury car website. And that is an AJ guarantee. This is
                  especially becuase all the prices are made up. I have been a
                  big fan of making front-end projects, and this one has been
                  really special and close to my heart as I love cars, and
                  coding. So to have a chance to combine the two together has
                  been one of my favorite and most fun projects that I have
                  worked on so far.
